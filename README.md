# Inventory-Management
Java inventory system for managing stock, recording sales, and detecting low inventory for restock.

This is my first attempt at developing a java application. The idea came up from real world challenges faced by small local grocery shops in Doha, Qatar. Many of these shops rely on manual, paper based systems to track inventory and sales which can lead to inefficiencies and errors.

The goal of this project is to keep track of the products, sales and stocks efficiently and accurately. This version currently only focuses on backend functionality and testing user interactions (through print statements) and I plan to extend the project my possibly including a database or CSV file. 

This project was created to test my ability to design and structure software from scractch, using OOP and considering the componenets that may interact with the system.

HOW IT WORKS:


FEATURES:
- Add new products that currently dont exist in the system
- Record Product sales
- Check for products that currently have a low stock
- View current available inventory
- Update stock threshold.
- Restock existing products

HOW TO RUN:
1. Clone repository
2. Open folder in java
3. Compile and run "InventorySystem.java"
